    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>This site takes inspiration from bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com which was inspired by motherfuckingwebsite.com. Clearly I'm not much of a front-end developer. But look who finally has a website! I wonder what I'll do with it... </p>

        <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
        <p>Check back later for updates on my projects, I still need to fish my old projects out of the deepest darkest nested archive folders of my file system...you know how it goes. Your desktop gets cluttered so you drop everything in a "Archive" folder. Then it gets cluttered again and now you drop everything in another "Archive" folder including the one you made previously. Before you know it you've got 6 or 7 levels of nested archive folders and you're forced to admit that you should've just pushed your projects to GitHub... </p>
